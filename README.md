# Plaster

A experimental 2D-ish render/game engine.

Just experimenting with WebGL2 and WebGPU, with some sparks of Rust/C in Web Assembly here and there... maybe some semi exotic APIs like the Gamepad API or the WebTransport API.

- [x] Full WbGL2 support
- [x] Limited WebGPU setup
- [x] Full support WebGL2
- [x] Orthogonal camera
- [x] Sprite loading
- [x] 2-axis + flat rotation movement control
- [ ] Basic camera (orthogonal?) with some 3D or parallax effect
- [x] Sprite animation (at least in infinite loop)
- [ ] Lighting, 2D casting shadows, semi 2D normal maps
- [ ] Multiplayer, maybe
- [ ] Gamepad support, likely
